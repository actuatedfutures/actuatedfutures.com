## Digital Homes With Actuate

### Award-winning sustainable developer Citu engaged Actuated Futures to digitally-enable their homes.

Working closely with the developer's team at every step, we're designing, implementing and running a digital service that helps homeowners and tenants to control and monitor their homes in a smart and fun way.

The service gives Citu a unique selling point for their new development at Little Kelham:

- cost-effective, proven smart metering and control technology built into every home
- real-time electricity, water and warmth monitoring and control by residents from their smartphones, tablets and other devices
- cloud-based billing and management systems for a multi-utility service company (MUSCo) set up and run on the developer's behalf
- a bespoke, branded service in the developer's own identity, including a complete demonstration installation for the marketing suite and show home.

We've also built in security monitoring, public transport information, car sharing and neighbourhood living information.

Citu is able to fulfil its promise of high-quality, low-cost living, safe in the knowledge that Actuated Futures will run and manage the infrastructure, the MUSCo and the user interface. We'll be there for the long term, coupling residents' data with our energy market know-how to help people improve and optimise the way they manage their homes.
