## We’re a future cities company

### Actuated Futures is here to connect people to places and neighbourhoods  and let them know more about where they live.

__Putting people in control__. We believe smart people are more important than smart buildings. Knowing more about where you live means you’re saving money, save the planet, make better choices.

__Making things for today not promises for tomorrow__. The cities of the future are being built right now, brick by brick and block by block. We aim to make a real difference at a neighbourhood level.

__Keeping it lean.__ We work in an agile way to create user-centred, human-scale services that minimise wasted work and resources by fitting around the way people really live their lives.
