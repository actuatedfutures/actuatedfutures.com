Location: Rai in Amsterdam.

The show, part of [ISE](http://www.iseurope.org/home.php), focuses on the convergence between buildings and  technology, and how this can reduce cost, waste and carbon. Fraser spoke  about the integration of smart metering at Greenhouse in Leeds, the  challenges along the way, and how it helped to reduce overall energy  consumption by 60%. Within the presentation that was made to key thought leaders in construction and technology, Fraser went on to describe how we are developing a cost effective smart phone based monitoring and control solution for Citu's latest project, [Little Kelham](http://littlekelham.com/) in Sheffield. This will help Citu to achieve zero carbon at Kelham, and is a key enabler to the success of it's [passive haus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house) design. 

> People think that buildings need to get smarter and make automated  decisions on behalf of their occupants to reduce energy. At Greenhouse we proved that empowering the occupant with simple consumption information and  peer based comparison is fundamental to individuals taking ownership of  their energy reduction, and embedding it this ethos community as a whole.  It's a different way of thinking, and the ultimate success is reducing  carbon withing the built environment is about empowering people to make  people smart, not smart buildings.
