As part of our development of the Actuate -  Digital Service that we have developed for CITU at Little Kelham, we needed to understand what people, who were going to live there, wanted from Actuate.

We had previously contributed to Hack the City in Sheffield, run by the Open Data Sheffield team, and using their ethos we invited them and other interested and interesting people from Sheffield  to work with the Actuated Futures team to spend the day at the Little Kelham Bakery and explore and test how a really useful digital solution could be added to  Actuate for Little Kelham.

Here are some pictures of the day, and a video of Paul Connell explaining more about the ethos and thinking behind the day.

and here are some screenshots of the current version of the  transport (plus much more) which the discovery day told us were important to people.
